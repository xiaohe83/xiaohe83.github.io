At first, I created a blog on Hashnode and wrote several articles. However, I discovered 
the free account doesn't allow Google search. In some articles, it adds the following header: 
```
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```
, which prevents Google from indexing them. Even after contacting customer support, 
I couldn't get a clear answer.

For writing, GitHub Pages is a great option, although it slightly technical. However, for programmers, it doesn't pose any barriers. I am grateful for Tao He's Jekyll-GitBook style, as it is incredibly useful.


Let's start a new trip!
